# PySpark
 pySpark basic project

 This project enabled me to grasp the basic commands in PySpark. I found PySpark very similar to
 pandas, and used SQL commands I am familiar with
 
 I also used google colab for the first time. I also found this very similar to jupyterlab. Loving getting to know more and more applications and tools
 of which I can use and apply to my daily life.
